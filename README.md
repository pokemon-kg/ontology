# Pokémon Ontology
This ontology aims to meticulously encapsulate the diverse and intricate
universe of Pokémon, as portrayed in both the video game series and the anime
television series. Its goal is to delve into a detailed classification and
characterization of Pokémon species, encompassing their unique abilities,
evolutionary paths, and elemental types.

The ontology also seeks to integrate the geographical expanse of the Pokémon
world, mapping out the various regions, cities, and landmarks pivotal to the
Pokémon narrative. It aims to profile key human characters, including Pokémon
trainers, Gym Leaders, and members of various organizations, highlighting their
relationships, roles, and development throughout the series. Additionally, it is
intended to encompass the complex system of Pokémon battles, trainer
interactions, and the socio-economic aspects of the Pokémon world, including
Pokémon Centers, Poké Marts, and other institutions.

* What are the various travel routes and pathways connecting two specific
regions?

**4. Trainer Information:**
* Who are the Gym Leaders of a particular region, and what types of Pokémon do
they specialize in?
